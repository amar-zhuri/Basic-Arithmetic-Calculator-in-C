# Basic Arithmetic Calculator in C

This C program implements a basic calculator for arithmetic operations. Users input two operands and an operator (+, -, *, /) separated by spaces. The program reads the input until EOF (End of File) is encountered. It then performs the corresponding operation and outputs the result.

## Usage
1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
gcc calculator.c -o calculator
2. Run the compiled executable:
./calculator
3. Enter arithmetic expressions in the format: operand1 operator operand2

## Example
$ ./calculator
5 + 3
8

## Note
- This program supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) operations.
- Press Ctrl + D (Linux/macOS) or Ctrl + Z (Windows) to signal EOF and terminate input.
